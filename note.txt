variable is a space in memory to reserve for something here we can store values

take care

__ numbers would not be wrapped in single or double quotes

__ string value or charcter must be wrapped in single or double quotes

__ if numbers are wrapped in single or double quotes if we are performing addtition instead of 
operation addtition it will concatenate the values

__ we can't use space in decalaring a variable

__ try to use camel casing in programming to  maintain a standard camelcasing example(fisrtName) 
if we are joining two words fisrt word should start with small letter and second word should startwith capital
letter

__ we can declare a varibale only once otherwise syntax error we can change value inside a variable

__ if we declare a constant don't try to change value inside the constant this will result in syntax error

__ in order to maintain standard in arithmetical operations use () brackets other wise more number will make our code complex
